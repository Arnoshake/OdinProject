We should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our website index.html. 
This is because web servers will by default look for an index.html page when users land on our websites â€“ and not having one will cause big problems.

<!DOCTYPE html> <!--tells browser what version of HTML to render (HTML5) -->
<html lang="en">    <!-- html element acts as the root/universal parent -->
    <!-- lang is an ATTRIBUTE of the html element-->

      <h3>Working with text in HTML!</h3>
        <p>This is being written within the paragraph label. This ensures that each instance of paragraph/text beings on a new line. There are six header elements. They provide a hierarchy to content where one is the biggest and most dominant. The strong element makes text <strong>bold</strong>. CSS can replace this functionality without having to attribute it with being "strong". The em element makes things <em>italic</em>.</p>
        <p>Indentation is important for readability. It visualizes parent-child relationships.</p>
        <p>To easily comment, type "CMD + /"</p>
        <p>To generate dummy text, type lorem!"</p>
